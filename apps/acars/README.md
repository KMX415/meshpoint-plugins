# acars

Optional Meshpoint receiver plugin, adapted from javastraat/meshpoint at `b18d6742de6c4cf7fb2e743c690400bea5790a9f`. Original author: Einstein PD2EMC.

This folder is catalog source, not an installed or enabled module. Install only the modules you want through Settings > Plugins. Receiver modules use the optional RTL-SDR host page; install and enable `rtlsdr` as well. Restart after enabling.

Required commands: acarsdec. Install the documented native tools on the device before enabling this module. Setup does not run automatically. See [the optional plugin guide](../../docs/PLUGINS.md) for package availability, setup limitations, hardware sharing, and removal.

Enabling creates an idle listener. Press Start in the plugin page to open the receiver. A running receiver holds the shared SDR until stopped; switching pages does not interrupt it.

This is unreleased integration work. Tests use mocked processes; device and RF validation remains required before release.

## Local receive channels

Enter one to eight local VHF receive channels before starting. No European
channel is silently substituted. The configured `plugins.acars.freqs` list is
preserved; selections in the running page do not automatically rewrite device
configuration. Usable simultaneous spacing also depends on the native decoder
and receiver. Stop before changing channels.
